Description: Consider estimating the counterfactual mean of a point intervention 
  (or the average treatment effect) when the causal structure is known and 
  described by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Suppose there is no unobserved 
  confounder. It turns out that not every variable in the graph is informative for 
  optimally estimating the counterfactual mean. This package identifies and 
  projects out all the uninformative variables from the DAG. Based on the reduced
  DAG, an efficient estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound with 
  respect to the original DAG. In particular, the g-formula (Robins, 1986) 
  prescribed by the reduced formula, when estimated with empirical plugin, is 
  efficient.
